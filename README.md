# 🎓 Series 65: The "I Passed, Now What?" Guide

Congratulations on passing the Series 65! Passing the exam is a huge milestone, but **you are not a licensed Investment Adviser Representative (IAR) yet.** This guide outlines the regulatory and professional steps required to officially launch your career.

## 🛑 Step 1: The "Clock is Ticking" (Administrative)
* **The Two-Year Rule:** Your exam credit is valid for exactly **24 months**. You must register with a firm (file a Form U4) within this window, or the credit expires and you must retake the exam.
* **Secure Your Score Report:** Download your passing certificate from Prometric immediately. You will need this for your firm's compliance records.
* **Accredited Investor Status:** As a Series 65 holder in good standing, you may now qualify as an "Accredited Investor." Note: This usually requires an active registration to be fully recognized for private placements.

## 🛣️ Step 2: Choose Your Path
You cannot legally provide investment advice for a fee until you are "associated" with a Registered Investment Adviser (RIA).

### Option A: Join an Existing RIA
* **Pros:** Lower costs, built-in compliance, mentorship, and immediate branding.
* **Process:** The firm will file a **Form U4** on your behalf via the FINRA CRD system.

### Option B: Start Your Own RIA
* **Pros:** 100% ownership, creative control, and higher payout potential.
* **Process:** You must register a legal business entity (LLC), apply for firm registration (Form ADV), and appoint a Chief Compliance Officer (usually yourself).

## 📝 Step 3: Registration & Licensing
Regardless of the path, these three items are mandatory:
1.  **Form U4 Filing:** Your personal "license application" detailing your 10-year employment history and any disclosures.
2.  **Fingerprinting:** Most states require a criminal background check via electronic fingerprinting.
3.  **State Approval:** You must be registered in your home state and any state where you have more than 5 clients (the "De Minimis" rule).
